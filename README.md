# About
This abs2pgsql project is devoted to providing a path for loading Australian
Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data into a PostgreSQL database.

In cases where ABS data is linked to the ASGS (Australian Statistical
Geography Standard) such fields reference the ASGS via the asgs schema as
created by [asgs2pgsql](https://github.com/andrewharvey/asgs2pgsql). For
these data releases you will need to have loaded the asgs schema into
your database.

# Preparation
All scripts expect you to set up PG* environment variables. These are used to
control which PostgreSQL database, hostname, port, username, etc. is used to
load the data into. Refer to the [PostgreSQL documentation](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/libpq-envars.html)
for help. So for example in your terminal window before running the scripts,
first run:

    export PGDATABASE=abs

# License, Copyright and Attribution
The licensing of this repository is slightly more complicated than usual. For
this reason I use a [DEP-5 style copyright file](http://dep.debian.net/deps/dep5/)
called `copyright`.

The short version is this repository is licensed under the Creative Commons
Zero 1.0 license, with some minor exceptions as noted in the `copyright` file.

I am seeking advise with regards to the licensing of this project.
Ideally I would like to use the CC0 license however I need to consider
the validity of this where much of this project is derived from ABS
copyrighted works. Particularly the [advice given by Creative Commons](http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Frequently_Asked_Questions#Can_I_combine_two_different_Creative_Commons_licensed_works.3F_Can_I_combine_a_Creative_Commons_licensed_work_with_another_non-CC_licensed_work.3F)
which says I can't license works derived from CC-BY works under CC0.
Since the ABS works are licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution
2.5 Australia licence and because this whole repository is a derived work
of those ABS works, I may need to choose the CC-BY license for this
repository in order for it all to be valid. I'm okay with that, but only
in the case that I can't use the CC0 license.

Unfortunately this conflicts with the advice also given by Creative
Commons with regards to [using the Creative Commons licenses for software](http://wiki.creativecommons.org/FAQ#Can_I_apply_a_Creative_Commons_license_to_software.3F).

However since all the code is not really very portable and is intended
for sole use with the ABS data, I don't think there is much need for a
portable software license.

I welcome advice with respect to this.
