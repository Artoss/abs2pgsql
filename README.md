# About
This abs2pgsql project is devoted to providing a path for loading Australian
Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data releases into a PostgreSQL database.

Because many of the ABS datasets are not released in a machine readable format
this project also contains tabular based files of ABS data releases where I've
manually extracted the data from the Microsoft Excel spreadsheets provided by
the ABS.

In cases where ABS data is linked to the ASGS (Australian Statistical Geography
Standard) such fields reference the ASGS via the asgs schema as created by
[asgs2pgsql](https://github.com/andrewharvey/asgs2pgsql). For these data
releases you will need to have loaded the asgs schema into your database.

# Running the scripts

The folders within this repository are ABS catalogue numbers. Within that folder
you should be able to simply run,

    make

To control which PostgreSQL database (and hostname, port, username, etc.) is
used to load the data into, set the [PG* environment variables](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/libpq-envars.html)
prior to running the make command. e.g.

    export PGDATABASE=abs

The following ABS data releases require the ASGS schema to be loaded (see About):

* 8731.0
